# Ballder-1
Python game for APCS final project

This game was designed and optimized to run on python 3.7.3 on a windows 64-bit machine. 

I wrote this game as I learned how to program in the python language, having practically no experience with it prior to starting. I learned how to program in python by stopping frequently, looking up how to structure the classes, pass arguments to methods, create loops, and solve many other problems. 

I used the premade graphics.py library to help with the visual aspects of the game, but designed everything myself, only using the most basic functions (to draw shapes, create a window, etc.
